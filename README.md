# iOS-Demo


This is an example project.

The app is composed of two parts. One is a location sharing app. You click the orange circle in the bottom right corner and it adds your location with a time stamp to the map. Everyone else that has the app can see your location.

The second part of the app is an instagram clone. To add a photo, click the camera icon in the bottom right corner, selecter a photo, add a caption and submit. Everyone else that has the app can see your post. 


Here is a video of the app:
